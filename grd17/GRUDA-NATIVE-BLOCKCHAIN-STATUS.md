# GRUDA Native Blockchain Status

## Overview

GRUDA Native Blockchain is now operational without external wallet providers like Crossmint. This is a pure blockchain implementation for the GRUDA ecosystem.

## Features Active

### Core Blockchain

- ✅ Genesis block creation
- ✅ Block mining with proof-of-work
- ✅ Transaction processing
- ✅ Chain validation
- ✅ Balance tracking

### Wallet Integration

- ✅ BIP39 seed phrase generation
- ✅ GRUDA address format (GRUDA + 32 character hash)
- ✅ Private/public key generation
- ✅ Local wallet storage

### Mining System

- ✅ OPMine algorithm implementation
- ✅ GPU mining simulation (850 KH/s target)
- ✅ Block rewards (1.0 GRUDA per block)
- ✅ Difficulty adjustment (4-digit target)

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/blockchain/stats` - Blockchain statistics
- `GET /api/blockchain/balance/:address` - Address balance
- `GET /api/blockchain/transactions/:address` - Transaction history
- `POST /api/blockchain/mine/:address` - Mine new block
- `POST /api/blockchain/mint-nft` - Mint NFTs on chain

## Wallet System

### Entry Process

1. User creates or imports GRUDA wallet
2. 12-word BIP39 seed phrase generated/validated
3. GRUDA address created (format: GRUDA + hash)
4. GPU mining automatically activated
5. Node ID assigned for network participation

### Security Features

- Seed phrases stored locally only
- Private keys never transmitted
- Client-side cryptographic operations
- Secure random number generation

## Mining Operations

### Block Mining

- Automatic mining when wallet created
- Real proof-of-work algorithm
- Block rewards added to wallet balance
- Mining statistics tracked real-time

### NFT Minting

- Native blockchain NFT support
- No external providers required
- Metadata stored on-chain
- Transaction hash tracking

## Network Status

- Blockchain validation: Active
- Mining difficulty: 4 (adjustable)
- Block time: Variable (proof-of-work)
- Network consensus: Single node (expandable)

## Integration Points

### AI Legion

- Each AI instance can have wallet
- Mining rewards for AI contributions
- Transaction fees for AI services

### Master Nodes

- Node operators earn mining rewards
- Validator status available
- Network participation tracking

### GRD-17 Validators

- Blockchain-based validation
- Stake-based consensus ready
- Reward distribution system

## No External Dependencies

- No Crossmint integration
- No third-party wallet providers
- Pure GRUDA blockchain implementation
- Self-contained ecosystem

## Current Issues

- Dashboard UI error: Wallet import needs fixing
- Frontend currently displaying ReferenceError
- Backend blockchain fully operational

## Next Steps

1. Fix Wallet icon import in dashboard
2. Test wallet creation and mining
3. Verify NFT minting functionality
4. Deploy blockchain statistics interface
